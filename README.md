## Technologies Used

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A modern build tool that provides a faster development experience for frontend projects.
- **Cloudflare Workers**: A serverless platform for deploying and running backend code at the edge of the network.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Programming languages used for both frontend and backend development.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used for running the backend code.
